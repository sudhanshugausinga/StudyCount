This software is basically an offline version of the web app "Big Timer". I created it for myself and so I thought why not share it!

This is just a countdown timer in which we can maximize the whole window by F11 or Ctrl+F which makes this timer look big enough so that you can see it from anywhere in your room.

Software Preview:
Screen 1: When we start the App

Screen 2: When we start the timer without toggling to full screen.
